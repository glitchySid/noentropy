## About

NoEntropy is a smart command-line tool that organizes your cluttered Downloads folder automatically. It uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze files, understand their content, and categorize them into organized folder structures. Say goodbye to manually sorting through hundreds of downloads!

## Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Categorization** - Uses Google Gemini API for intelligent file sorting
- **🎨 Custom Categories** - Define your own categories for personalized organization
- **📁 Automatic Sub-Folders** - Creates relevant sub-folders based on file content analysis
- **💨 Smart Caching** - Minimizes API calls with metadata-based caching (7-day expiry)
- **⚡ Concurrent Processing** - Parallel file inspection with configurable limits
- **👀 Dry-Run Mode** - Preview changes without moving any files
- **📝 Text File Support** - Inspects 30+ text formats for better categorization
- **✅ Interactive Confirmation** - Review organization plan before execution
- **↩️ Undo Support** - Revert file organization changes if needed

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary**

## Use Cases

- 📂 Organize a messy Downloads folder
- 🤖 Auto-categorize downloaded files by type and content
- 🔍 Smart sub-folder creation based on file content
- 🚀 Batch file organization without manual effort
- 💾 Reduce clutter and improve file system organization

## Key Features Explained

### Custom Categories

Define your own categories instead of using defaults:

```toml
# config.toml
categories = ["Work", "Personal", "School", "Projects", "Bills", "Media", "Misc"]
```

Perfect for organizing files based on your specific workflow. See the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for examples.

### Smart Caching

NoEntropy caches API responses for 7 days to minimize costs and improve performance. Files are only re-analyzed if they change (based on size and modification time).

### Undo Functionality

Made a mistake? Easily undo the last organization:

```bash
./noentropy --undo
```

All file moves are tracked for 30 days with full conflict detection and safety features.

## Requirements

- **Rust 2024 Edition** or later (if building from source)
- **Google Gemini API Key** - Get one at [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)
