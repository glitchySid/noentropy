# NoEntropy Configuration File
# Location: ~/.config/noentropy/config.toml

# Your Google Gemini API Key
# Get one at: https://ai.google.dev/
api_key = "your_api_key_here"

# Path to folder to organize (e.g., ~/Downloads)
download_folder = "/path/to/your/downloads"

# Optional: Custom categories for file organization
# If not specified, uses default categories: Images, Documents, Installers, Music, Archives, Code, Misc
# Uncomment and customize the list below to use your own categories:
# categories = ["Work", "Personal", "School", "Projects", "Bills", "Media", "Misc"]

# Optional: Enable AI deep inspection for smart sub-categorization
# When enabled, NoEntropy reads text file contents to suggest sub-folders (e.g., Documents/Invoices)
# When disabled (default), NoEntropy only categorizes by file name into main folders (e.g., Documents/)
# Deep inspection provides better organization but is slower for large file collections
# Set to true if you want more detailed organization, false for faster processing
# deep_inspect = false
